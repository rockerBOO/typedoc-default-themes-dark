# Default themes for TypeDoc with addition of prefers-color-scheme: dark colors

Uses default themes from https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc-default-themes with the addition of dark colors for the default theme. 

`@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`

See: [src/default/assets/css/_theme.scss](https://github.com/rockerBOO/typedoc-default-themes-dark/blob/dark-theme/src/default/assets/css/_theme.scss)

**Note:** Made for Typedoc < 0.22, as the templating changes in 0.22 to JSX. It seems to support some level of light/dark themes. 

## Install

```sh
npm add --dev typedoc-default-themes-dark
```
